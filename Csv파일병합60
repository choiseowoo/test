To shift fields dynamically, you can expand the fields array after inserting the `macaddress` and `ipaddress` values at the appropriate indexes. Hereâ€™s how you can adjust the fields without disrupting the order:

### Adjusted VBS Code to Shift Fields

```vbscript
Dim fso, inputFile, outputStream, line, fields, macAddressField

' Create File System Object
Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

' Open input CSV file
Set inputFile = fso.OpenTextFile("tanium.csv", 1) ' ForReading mode

' Set up output file (no BOM, UTF-8)
Set outputStream = fso.CreateTextFile("output.csv", True, False)

Do Until inputFile.AtEndOfStream
    line = inputFile.ReadLine
    fields = Split(line, ",") ' Split fields by comma

    ' Ensure we have enough fields to modify
    If UBound(fields) >= 5 Then
        ' Split macaddress and ipaddress if "|" is present in the macaddress field
        macAddressField = fields(5)
        macParts = Split(macAddressField, "|")

        ' Prepare array for shifted values
        ReDim Preserve fields(UBound(fields) + 1)

        ' Shift fields 6 through end by one position to the right
        For i = UBound(fields) - 1 To 6 Step -1
            fields(i + 1) = fields(i)
        Next

        ' Insert split macaddress and ipaddress
        fields(5) = Trim(macParts(0)) ' macaddress
        If UBound(macParts) >= 1 Then
            fields(6) = Trim(macParts(1)) ' ipaddress if available
        Else
            fields(6) = "" ' Leave blank if ipaddress is not provided
        End If

        ' Write the modified line to output
        outputStream.WriteLine Join(fields, ",")
    End If
Loop

' Close resources
outputStream.Close
inputFile.Close
Set outputStream = Nothing
Set inputFile = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing
```

### Explanation
1. **Shift Fields**: We expand the array by one additional slot and then shift the fields starting from index 6 to the end by one position to the right.
2. **Insert Values**: After shifting, we insert the `macaddress` into index 5 and the `ipaddress` into index 6.
3. **Write to Output**: Finally, write the modified line to the output file, which will now have properly shifted fields. 

This should ensure your fields are correctly realigned without data loss.
